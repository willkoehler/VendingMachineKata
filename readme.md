## Steps to run the code

There is not a runtime environment (or "main" function) at this point. The code
is exercised via the RSpec tests.

Start by installing necessary gems

    cd [folder where you cloned the code]
    bundle

Then run the tests

    bin/rspec

Or use guard to run the tests automatically as you work

    bundle exec guard
